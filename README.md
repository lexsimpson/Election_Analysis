## Summary
This script is very useful not only for this election, but for other elections as well. With simple modifications possibly to cell numbers or type of data to extract, we could use this same code with other large data sets. This could be helpful to an individual's campaign in knowing which county has the highest turnout of voters, this way if they do not have time to visit all counties maybe they could focus their energy on the county with the highest turnout. In addition to this, by knowing the type of candidate a county usually votes for, it can help guide campaign plans. If we know a particular county usually votes for the republican candidate, maybe a campaign will stress their policies that will appeal to this audience.
